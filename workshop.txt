Welcome to C tricks and forgotten things workshop. I advise to start with attributes
but you do as you want.

I only did part of the attributes, there are lots of others, if you liked don't hesitate to go see the rest yourself:
    - for functions: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.7.2/gcc/Function-Attributes.html (I advise nonnull, hot, cold, visibility, leaf, nothrow)
    - for types: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.7.2/gcc/Type-Attributes.html#Type-Attributes
    - for variables: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.7.2/gcc/Variable-Attributes.html#Variable-Attributes

For the keyword, I chose the ones we didn't see at Epitech.

The system part in keywords is called like that because they have system syntax with
the underscore but it's not more difficult or other.

Some keywords and attributes do the same or similar, often due to the fact that
we are on an advanced version of C but the corresponding keywords was not always there.

For the format, everything is in the header of each file.

There is a inlining.txt file at root it explain the concept of inlining,
it will be necessary to understand it for certain things in the workshop.
